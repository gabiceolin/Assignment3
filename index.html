							<h1>Traditional brazilian candies</h1>
							<h2>Brazilian food is a melting pot of three major cultures. For nearly three centuries, Portuguese explorers, enslaved Africans and native peoples incorporated, adapted, and interchanged their cultural backgrounds, helping shape Brazilian cuisine's foundations.
							The migration waves between the end of the 19th century and the first half of the 20th century also contributed to the vibrant Brazilian cuisine. Newcomers from Japan, Italy, Germany and the Middle East brought their cultural traditions and eating habits to communities established in different parts of the country once they set foot in the New World.

						<h2>MOST FAMOUS CANDIES</h2>
						<p>Among the country's many multicultural representations, sweets are a clear example of the syncretism that took place in the kitchens enjoying a special place in any family cookbook. Many traditional desserts originated from the marriage between Europeans, Africans and Brazilian Indians. The arrival of the royal court to Rio de Janeiro at the beginning of the 19th century also boosted the exchange of an abundance of recipes and cooking techniques. Once in tropical lands, traditional European preparations were inevitably adopted and adapted. Using local ingredients like coconut and peanut, Brazilians created new interpretations of puddings and other classic recipes from the Old World.</p>

								<h3>BRIGADEIRO</h3>
								<span class="icon"><i class="ion-quote"></i></span>
								<p>Legend tells housewives created this beloved national sweet in Rio de Janeiro. They started selling it during the fund-raising campaigns for Brigadier Eduardo Gomes in 1945. He didn't win the presidential elections, but his brigadeiros (bree-gah-day-ros) found a special place at every kid's birthday party. This simple recipe uses only three ingredients: sweetened condensed milk, butter and chocolate powder, slowly cooked until a smooth texture. Then they are hand-rolled into balls and covered with chocolate sprinkles.</p>
